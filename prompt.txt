You are asked to come up with a set of 5 diverse task instructions to teach the model about the open source project Konflux. These task instructions will be given to a GPT model and we will evaluate the GPT model for completing the instructions.

Here are the requirements:
1. Try not to repeat the verb for each instruction to maximize diversity.
2. The language used for the instruction also should be diverse. For example, you should combine questions with imperative instructions.
3. The type of instructions should be similar to the provided examples. The generated instruction and the output should be based on the provided document.
4. A GPT language model should be able to complete the instruction. For example, do not ask the assistant to create any visual or audio output. For another example, do not ask the assistant to wake you up at 5pm or set a reminder because it cannot perform any action.
5. The instructions should be in English.
6. The instructions should be 1 to 2 sentences long. Either an imperative sentence or a question is permitted.
7. The output should be an appropriate response to the input and the instruction. Long outputs are preferable.

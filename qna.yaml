  - question: What is the Konflux open source project?
    answer: >
      Konflux is your one stop shop for building, testing, and deploying source
      code with secure CI/CD. Simply input the URL of your repository into our
      service, and we get to work building a pipeline, generating a snapshot,
      testing your code, and ultimately deploying your application to the hybrid
      cloud. Quickly get your app out to the world and then immediately see the
      value that it creates.
  - question: What technologies does Konflux use under the hood?
    answer: >
      Under the hood, Konflux is largely based on OpenShift, Tekton, and ArgoCD.
  - question: What is the Enterprise Contract in Konflux?
    answer: >
      The Enterprise Contract (EC) is an artifact verifier and customizable policy
      checker. By default, Konflux adds the Enterprise Contract as an integration
      test to each new application. The Enterprise Contract then keeps your software
      supply chain secure and ensures container images comply with your organization’s
      policies. It does this by verifying the security and provenance of builds
      created through Konflux.
  - question: How do I import code from my GitHub repository in Konflux?
    answer: >
      To use your own code to build your application with Konflux, complete the
      following steps:

      1. Enter the link to your repository in the Git repository URL field. Note
      that this should be a public repository. Konflux verifies your URL right away.
      You don’t even have to press Enter.

      2. Optional: Add a Git reference to point to code in a specific branch, tag,
      or commit that you want to use to build your application.

      3. Optional: Indicate a Context directory to specify the subdirectory for
      the source code you want to use.

      4. Click Import code.
  - question: Why might I want to upgrade my Konflux build pipeline to a custom build?
    answer: >
      There are three reasons you might want to upgrade your build pipeline to a
      custom build:

      * Customize: Upgrading the build pipeline enables you to tailor the build
      process that Konflux uses for the components of your application, to better
      meet your specific needs.

      * Reinforce security: When you upgrade, Konflux adds a variety of security
      checks and scans on your pipeline that get run on each build.

      * Continuous integration: Upgraded build pipelines automatically rebuild
      your components every time a new commit is added to a pull request or merged
      into the configured branch of their repositories.

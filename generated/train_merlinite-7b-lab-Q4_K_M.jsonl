You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Explain the concept of hermetic builds in the context of Konflux using the document.", "assistant": "A hermetic build in Konflux is a secure, self-contained build process that doesn't depend on anything outside of the build environment. This means that it does not have network access, is not vulnerable to external influences, and cannot fetch dependencies at run time. Instead, you must declare all required resources and dependencies in your build definition. To enable hermetic builds in Konflux, set the `hermetic` parameter in your pipeline definition file to `true`. This will isolate the build from the network, restricting it to building only from dependencies listed in your Git repository. This method improves security, simplifies the build process, and enhances resource optimization.\nHowever, hermetic builds may fail if dependencies exist outside the Git repository, such as supported languages or package manager dependencies. To prevent this, you can prefetch package manager dependencies for the hermetic build, as described in the [Configuration as Code](../configuration-as-code/proc_configuration_as_code/) documentation."}

This process is initiated when the system builds your application using community dependencies. The JVM Build Service then analyzes your application and determines which dependencies need to be rebuilt. Once the dependencies are rebuilt, the JVM Build Service generates `ArtifactBuild` objects to represent each artifact in your application before determining to which repository the artifacts belong. The system analyzes the repository and uses the results to find a build strategy, such as using all JDK versions to determine the most effective one. The system attempts to build all the dependencies and stores them in container images in an image registry, such as `quay.io`. When the system has completed all its builds, you can rebuild your application. If all the builds are successful, your application's SBOM displays that none of the dependencies came from third-party repositories.

The system builds your application by using community dependencies. This is done automatically when the application is submitted for building in the Konflux project's pipeline runs.\n2. The JVM Build Service analyzes your application and determines which dependencies the system needs to rebuild. This process is also automatic, and the JVM Build Service generates `ArtifactBuild` objects to represent each artifact in your application before determining to which repository the artifacts belong.\n3. The system analyzes the repository and uses the results to find a build strategy. For example, if the system cannot find the JDK version to use, the system uses all versions to determine the most effective version to use. This analysis is also performed automatically.\n4. The system attempts to build all the dependencies and stores them in container images in an image registry, with `quay.io` being the default. This process is also automatic.\n5. When the system has completed all its builds, you can rebuild your application manually. This can be done using the `setup rebuilds` command in the CLI, as described in Task 1.\n6. If all the builds are successful, your application's SBOM displays that none of the dependencies came from third-party repositories. However, you may need to troubleshoot when some dependencies fail to build.\n\nBy following this process, you can ensure that your Java applications use community dependencies in a controlled and secure environment, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities or security issues caused by unknown provenance in binary jar files from central repositories."}

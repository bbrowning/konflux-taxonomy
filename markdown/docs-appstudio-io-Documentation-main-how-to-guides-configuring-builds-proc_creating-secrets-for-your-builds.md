Creating secrets for your builds
================================

When you building your pipelines, you might want to add tasks that require **secrets** in order to access external resources.



|  | One such task is the [sast-snyk-check](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-definitions/tree/main/task/sast-snyk-check) task that that uses the third-party service [snyk](https://snyk.io/) to perform static application security testing (SAST) as a part of the default Konflux pipeline. Use this procedure to upload your snyk.io token. Name the secret `sast_snyk_task` so that the snyk task in the Konflux pipeline will recognize it and use it. |

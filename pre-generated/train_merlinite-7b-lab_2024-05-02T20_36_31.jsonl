How can I choose which environment to use for building and testing my applications?", "assistant": "Public, private, and develop environments are different types of compute resources that you can use for developing, testing, and staging your applications in Konflux.\n\n* Public: These environments are shared among multiple users and are typically used for testing applications in a production-like environment. They are free to use but may have limited resources.\n* Private: These environments are dedicated to a specific user or team and offer more control and dedicated resources. They require a payment but provide a more predictable and consistent environment for testing and staging applications.\n* Develop: These environments are used for local development and testing purposes. They are typically configured with the same resources as the public or private environments but are not accessible to other users.\n\nTo choose which environment to use for building and testing your applications, consider the following factors:\n\n* Performance: If you need high performance and predictable resources, consider using a private environment.\n* Cost: If you are on a budget, consider using a public environment, but be aware that it may have limited resources and may not be suitable for all use cases.\n* Security: If you have sensitive data or need to comply with specific security standards, consider using a private environment.\n* Collaboration: If you need to collaborate with other developers, consider using a public or develop environment.\n\nBased on your specific use case and requirements, you can choose the environment that best fits your needs."}

Specifically, you must adjust the `pipelinesascode.tekton.dev/on-cel-expression` annotation to specify and filter by the right branch name. For example, for a pull request pipeline that resides in the `v1.0.0` branch, the annotation value would be \"event == \"pull\\_request\" && target\\_branch == \"v1.0.0\"`. Similarly, for a push pipeline in the same branch, the value would be \"event == \"push\" && target\\_branch == \"v1.0.0\"`. Additionally, adjust the `appstudio.openshift.io/application` and `appstudio.openshift.io/component` labels to specify the right Application and Component respectively."}

It performs several tasks, such as pull request approvals, update scanning, secret scan and ARP scanning.\n\nThe security pipeline is controlled by a policy encoded in Policy as Code specifications. The policy can be used to define required checks, scans, and other security measures. For example, the policy may require that all pull requests be approved before they can be merged, that all repositories be scanned for common security vulnerabilities, and that any secrets, such as API and cryptographic keys, be scanned for exposure to unauthorized users.\n\nThe security pipeline runs as part of the continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipeline, and it applies any required remediation steps if security issues are detected. By integrating the security pipeline into the CI/CD pipeline, developers can be sure that their applications are secure and that they meet all required security standards."}

It leverages the CNCF Open Policy Agent project's open policy repository and external policy management systems to define and enforce policies in your Konflux environment.\n\nThe PaC Framework enables developers to define policies in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is more intuitive and easier to understand compared to raw Rego. This makes it easier for developers to write, test, and maintain policies, even if they have limited experience with the Rego language.\n\nThe PaC Framework also provides a high-level API for creating and applying policies, as well as tools for debugging and validating policies. These features make it easier for developers to integrate the PaC Framework into their existing CI/CD pipelines, ensuring that security policies are consistently enforced across their environments."}

A hermetic build is a type of build that restricts network access to the build process. This means that Konflux cannot retrieve build dependencies directly from a package repository. Instead, it must pre-fetch and store the dependencies locally before starting the build process.\n\nOn the other hand, a non-hermetic build is a type of build that allows network access to the build process. In this case, Konflux can retrieve build dependencies directly from a package repository without any pre-fetching or storing locally.\n\nIn the case of Cachi2, a component in a hermetic build would follow these steps:\n\n1. The component uses Cachi2’s dependency pre-fetching feature to retrieve the dependencies without an internet connection.\n2. Cachi2 scans the source code and identifies the dependencies based on the lockfile or requirements file.\n3. Cachi2 then downloads the external dependencies from the package repository and stores them locally.\n\nIn contrast, a component in a non-hermetic build would use Cachi2 to retrieve dependencies directly from the package repository during the build process.\n\nFor more information on hermetic builds with Cachi2, refer to the documentation on [Cachi2 and Hermetic Builds](https://docs.konflux.io/cachi2/cachi2-and-hermetic-builds/)."}

This service is crucial because the Java ecosystem uses a binary distribution model, where binary jar files are downloaded from central repositories such as Maven Central. As a result, manually rebuilding the component libraries is necessary to build applications from source in a trusted environment.\n\nJVM Build Service simplifies this process by analyzing your application and determining which dependencies need to be rebuilt. It then generates `ArtifactBuild` objects to represent each artifact in your application and tags the systems from which the artifacts derive. Finally, it analyzes the repository, uses the results to find a build strategy, and attempts to build all dependencies, storing them in container images in an image registry like `quay.io`.\n\nOnce the builds are completed, you can rebuild your application, and the System Build of Materials (SBOM) will display that none of the dependencies came from third-party repositories if all the builds are successful. However, you may need to troubleshoot when some dependencies fail to build."}

This is important because the Java ecosystem uses a binary distribution model, where binary jar files are downloaded from central repositories, such as Maven Central. This distribution model means that the only way to ensure an application is completely built from source is to rebuild all its component libraries from source in a trusted environment."}

How do I specify this relationship between components?", "assistant": "When a component depends on another component in Konflux, you need to adjust the `.tekton/<name of component>.yaml` file in the component's repository to specify this relationship. You can use the `dependsOn` key within the pipeline to reference other pipelines that the component depends on. The `dependsOn` key accepts an array of pipeline names, so you can specify multiple pipelines if necessary.\n\nFor example, if component A relies on component B, you would add the following line to the `.tekton/componentA.yaml` file:\n\n```\ndependsOn:\n- componentB\n```\n\nThis line indicates that the build pipeline for component A should wait for the build pipeline of component B to complete before starting its own build process. This way, component A can use the results of component B's build as input, ensuring a consistent and accurate build for the application."}

You are helpful and harmless and you follow ethical guidelines and promote positive behavior.", "user": "Can you explain how to configure the readiness probe for an application in Konflux?", "assistant": "To configure the readiness probe for an application in Konflux, you can use the `kustomize` command to create a custom resource (CR) definition for the readiness probe. This CR definition should be placed in the `overlays/application-xyz/application.yaml` file, where `application-xyz` is the name of your application.\n\nHere's an example of a custom resource definition for a readiness probe:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: application-xyz\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        ...\n      readinessProbe:\n        httpGet:\n          path: /healthz\n          port: 8080\n        initialDelaySeconds: 5\n        periodSeconds: 5\n```\n\nIn this example, the readiness probe checks the `/healthz` endpoint of the application every 5 seconds. The initial delay of 5 seconds allows the application to start before the readiness probe is triggered.\n\nYou can also configure the readiness probe using annotations in the `deployment.yaml` file. Here's an example of how to configure the readiness probe using annotations:\n\n```yaml\napiVersion: apps/v1\nkind: Deployment\nmetadata:\n  name: application-xyz\nspec:\n  template:\n    spec:\n      containers:\n        ...\n      readinessProbe:\n        httpGet:\n          path: /healthz\n          port: 8080\n      readinessProbe.additionalProbeConfig:\n        httpGet:\n          path: /status\n          port: 8080\n        periodSeconds: 5\n        failureThreshold: 3\n```\n\nIn this example, the readiness probe checks the `/healthz` endpoint every 5 seconds. The additional probe checks the `/status` endpoint every 5 seconds, and the failure threshold is set to 3. This means that the application is considered ready if both probes succeed, and the application is considered unready if either probe fails three times.\n\nTo learn more about configuring readiness probes in Konflux, refer to the documentation on [Configuring Readiness Probes](https://docs.konflux.io/documentation/configuring-readiness-probes/)."}

Provenance is about maintaining verifiable information about software artifacts, including how they were produced, while build isolation focuses on preventing tampering with the build process.\n\nSLSA provenance is expressed through attestations that describe how an artifact was built, and these attestations can be signed to ensure their authenticity. Build isolation, on the other hand, involves running builds in a hosted environment that is isolated from other builds, users, and the control plane.\n\nAccuracy of provenance and build isolation intersect where provenance must be unforgeable. To generate unforgeable provenance, build platforms must store those secret materials in a secure management system that platform users cannot access. In Konflux, only Tekton Chains, which generates and signs provenance, has access to the private key.\n\nBy combining SLSA provenance and build isolation, Konflux ensures that its software artifacts are built securely and their provenance can be verified, making them reliable and trustworthy for use."}

Providing a record of the build process that produced a software artifact, provenance is the factor that SLSA assigns as the basis for verifying the authenticity of a build. Build isolation, on the other hand, ensures that the build platform does not allow any external influence on the build process, protecting the build platform and the software artifacts it produces from potential security threats and ensuring that they are accurate and reliable.\n\nKonflux provides SLSA provenance through an attestation, a key element of which is a subject telling you which artifact belongs to the attestation, as well as a predicate explaining how Konflux built each artifact and providing relevant links. The attestation also includes signing by Konflux via a private key, which further enhances its reliability as well as proof of its authenticity.\n\nTo ensure build isolation, Konflux uses a hosted build platform on shared or dedicated infrastructure, not on an individual’s workstation. This hosted build platform executes builds in a way that is consistent with the hosted infrastructure and can protect the builds from malware and other security threats.\n\nFurthermore, Konflux executes builds in an environment that is internally isolated within the larger hosted environment, protecting the builds from external influence that is not requested by the build process itself. This setup ensures that Konflux builds its software artifacts securely, verifiably, and accurately."}

It's used to deploy and run the application in a Kubernetes cluster.\n\nThese components work together to create a seamless development experience for software applications in a Kubernetes environment. By using these components, developers can quickly build, test, and deploy their applications with greater efficiency and consistency."}

By default, Konflux rebuilds a component only if a PR includes changes to that component. However, you can adjust the default configuration to better suit your needs by editing the `on-cel-expression` annotation in the `/.tekton/<name of component>-on-pull-request.yaml` file. This allows you to specify the paths that you want to trigger rebuilds. PRs with changes to files in those paths will cause Konflux to rebuild the component. Misconfiguring this value can prevent builds from starting or cause them to start at the wrong time. Proper configuration ensures that redundant rebuilds are prevented and build processes are managed efficiently."}
